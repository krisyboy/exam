  <h2>O hi! Im Kris</h2>
  <p>Im 28 years old (i think), and I like coding, dancing and making movies. Here, take a look at this cool still of me from a movie:</p>
  <img src="img/profile.PNG" alt="guy gets shot in head" width="50%">
  <p>Isn't that wild? No worries tho, I'm alright, mostly... physically... But I digress</p>
  <p>Im from Russia, which is cool I guess. <br> Except for the fact that I am limited to my job offers in Norway. For instance I can't develop for a company that has a security clearance above "secret", not even a low-level front-end job</p>
  <p>But I get it, it's an issue of national security. Wouldn't want the government sites to be filles with russian memes like this one:</p>
